## Feature Task

* [ ] Write a function called fizz buzz tree
  * [ ] Arguments: k-ary tree
  * [ ] Returns: modified k-ary tree

* [ ] Determine whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3 or 5 or both. Modify the tree as follows:
  * [ ] Value divisible by 3 --> replace with "Fizz"
  * [ ] Value divisible by 5 --> replace with "Buzz"
  * [ ] Value divisible by 3 AND 5 --> replace with "FizzBuzz"
  * [ ] Value not divisible by 3 or 5 --> return number as String

## Requirements

* [ ] Write unit tests
* [ ] Whiteboard
* [ ] Well-formatted README
