## Singly Linked List

* [ ] Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.

* [ ] Within your LinkedList class, include a head property. Upon instantiation, an empty LinkedList should be created.
  * [ ] Define a method called `insert` which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the `head` of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
  * [ ] Define a method called `includes` which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Node's value somewhere in the list.
  * [ ] Define a method called `__str__` which takes no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formated as:
    * `"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NONE"`

<!-- ## Approach & Efficiency -->
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
